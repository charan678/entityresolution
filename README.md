# entityresolution
Entity Resolution refers to the task of finding all mentions of same -real world entity within a knowledge base or across multiple knowledge bases. This can be achieved through linking and grouping.

#

Deduplication: The process of clustering/grouping records or mentions that represent the same real world entity .
Record Linkage: The process of matching records from one deduplicated knowledge base to another.
Canonicalisation: The process of converting data with more than one possible representation into a standard form.
Reference Matching: The process of matching noisy records to clean ones in a deduplicated reference table.


#Framework

There are 4 phases: 

1. preprocessing phase 
2. blocking phase 
3. similarity computation phase and match classification phase
4. clustering phase
